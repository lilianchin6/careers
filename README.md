This is an RShiny app visualizing data on 4000 student responses about post-education plans between 2012-2014 provided by the Career and Professional Development Center at Carnegie Mellon University. It explores where students go after graduation, whether industry or more schooling, salary breakdown by industry, the relationship between employers and majors, and more.

Examples of some data that was collected:

- Degree Earned
- Post Graduation Status
- Name of Graduate School or Employeer
- Annual Salary
- Job Title and Industry

Note that there is some survey bias present as this was a voluntary survey where not all fields needed to be filled out. We especially see this effect in annual salary. In addition, we have more responses from STEM-heavy fields.
